      <h2>What are Rom-Coms?</h2>
      <p>
        Rom-Com stands for Romantic comedy, often abbreviated as "romcom," is a
        popular genre in anime that combines elements of romance and humor.
        These series typically revolve around the romantic relationships between
        characters, often in a lighthearted and humorous manner. Romantic comedy
        anime, or romcom, is a popular genre blending romance and humor. Common
        features include high school settings, misunderstandings, love
        triangles, quirky characters, tsundere archetypes, clich√©s, slice of
        life elements, physical comedy, and unconventional premises. Despite the
        comedic focus, romcoms also incorporate heartwarming moments to explore
        genuine emotions and character growth.
